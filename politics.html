                "body": `
                Former Himachal Pradesh BJP president Khimi Ram defected from the party unit to join Congress earlier this year and now the Opposition party, which is looking to return to power, has fielded him from his home turf Banjar in Kullu district. Further dealing a blow to the ruling party's chances is an internal rebellion in the constituency.

        The 73-year-old entered politics in the 1990s and held a post in the district council. He went on to contest elections from Banjar in 2003 on a BJP ticket and won. He retained the seat in the Assembly polls four years later. The same year, Khimi was also elected Deputy Speaker of the state Assembly.
    
        With Dhumal’s backing he became the state BJP president in 2009 after Jai Ram Thakur, the current chief minister, was inducted into the Cabinet. The following year, Ram was unanimously re-elected to the post. But his tenure was marked by infighting in the state unit and saw the exit of former state party president and former MP Maheshwar Singh in December 2011 over his decision to drop Naveen Dhiman and Tikku Thakur from the BJP’s state body and district unit.
        Thakur was later removed as the president and moved to cabinet in the Dhumal government. He was denied an election ticket in 2017 despite expressing his desire to contest the Assembly elections again from Banjar.
        The Banjar seat will be looking at a three-way contest between Ram, incumbent MLA Surender Shourie of the BJP and Maheshwar Singh’s son Hiteshwar Singh, who is contesting as an Independent. Maheshwar’s Singh ticket was cancelled after he failed to convince Hiteshwar to withdraw his candidature.

                "body": `For India’s democracy to really work, it needs smaller units of governance, Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee said Friday.

                “There is a fundamental problem with the design of our democracy which is that our states are way too large. We have twenty times larger seats for Parliament than the United Kingdom has,” Banerjee said.
                
                Banerjee was delivering the 27th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture on the “Democracy on the ground: What works, what doesn’t and why?”
                
                Banerjee said that although India has a population 20 times that of the UK, the UK has 656 seats in its Parliament compared to 543 in India. He argued that the vast size makes it difficult for all voters to access information about their legislators.
                Citing his field experiments with Delhi municipal elections, Banerjee said that if voters are given information on the performance of those elected, their pattern of voting changes. “There’s almost nothing that a legislator does that can really reach you (the voter). Therefore, the leaders on the ground matter very little for our voters. That’s a structural problem in our democracy,” Banerjee said.
                
                Justice Hima Kohli of the Supreme Court also spoke at the event, recounting her memories of Justice Bhandare. “Very few know that she joined law college after she got married and she had enrolled with the Maharashtra Bar Council when she was a mother of two,” Justice Kohli said. Justice Bhandare was a former judge of the Delhi High Court who died in office at the age of 52.`,

                "body": `
                AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal on Friday welcomed the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish
            Kumar, and urged the Congress in Assam and the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC to join the opposition grouping to
            defeat the ruling BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.
            
            Ajmal, a Lok Sabha MP from Dhubri constituency, said Kumar and leaders of the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ will visit
            Assam next month to explore possibilities of expanding the grouping. The Congress is a part of the
            ‘Mahagathbandhan’ in Bihar.
            
            “When they will come, I hope that the Congress (in Assam) and Mamata Banerjee will join the
            ‘Mahagathbandhan’. Our common enemy is the BJP and together we will be able to defeat them in 2024,” he told
            reporters here.
            Ajmal also sought to form an alliance again with its former ally Congress for the panchayat and Lok Sabha
            elections in Assam in order to defeat their “common enemy BJP”.
            “Unless we are united, we cannot defeat the BJP. So, let us join hands again for defeating the BJP,” he
            said.
            
            Reacting to Ajmal’s proposal, Assam Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said no such alliance will take
            place between the two opposition parties again in the future.
            
            “We have been always saying that AIUDF is equally communal like the BJP. We will form an alliance with the
            people of Dhubri, but not with a trader,” he said referring to Ajmal’s perfume business.
            Interestingly, the Congress on November 1 kick-started the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ in Assam from Dhubri
            district, Ajmal’s home turf, and plans to cover 834 km in the next 70 days.
            
            Borah further said, “If an alliance takes place between the Congress and AIUDF, I will not be the president
            of the state Congress.” Prior to the Assam Assembly elections in 2021, the Congress had formed a ‘Grand
            Alliance’ with AIUDF, BPF, CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML), Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM), RJD, Adivasi National Party
            (ANP) and Jimochayan (Deori) Peoples Party (JPP) to fight against the BJP-led NDA.
            
            After facing defeat, the Congress in August last year broke the alliance with AIUDF. The core committee of
            the state Congress also opted to break its association with the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), while the
            CPI(M) said it only had a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress and was not a part of any alliance.

                "body": `
                Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday said the present Supreme Court collegium system through which judges are appointed is “opaque”.

The “fittest” persons should be appointed as judges and not someone whom the collegium knows, he said.

The Union minister was speaking on 'Reforming Judiciary at the India Today conclave here. “I am not critical of the judiciary or the judges…I am not happy with the present system of the Supreme Court collegium. No system is perfect. We have to always strive and work towards a better system,” the minister said. The system has to be accountable and transparent, he said, adding, “If it is opaque, then who else will speak up against it if not the concerned minister.” He was only “reflecting the thinking” of the people including the lawyer community and even some judges, he said.

“The basic fault with the present collegium system is that the judges are recommending those colleagues whom they know. Obviously, they would not recommend a judge they do not know,” Rijiju said.

“The fittest should be appointed and not someone whom the collegium knows,” the minister said.
Asked how the process would be different if the government were to be involved, Rijiju said the government has an independent mechanism to collect information and carry out due diligence.

“The government has the intelligence bureau and several other reports to rely on before taking a decision. The judiciary or the judges do not have this,” he said.

Across the world, governments appoint judges, the law minister said.
“There is politics in the judiciary too because of this. They (judges) may not show it but there is intense politics,” Rijiju said.

“Should the judges be stuck in such administrative work or spend more time in dispensing justice,” he asked.

On the Supreme Court rejecting the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, Rijiju said the government had not said anything on it so far.

“When it was struck down, the government could have done something…but it did not as it respects the judiciary. But that does not mean we will keep quiet always,” he said.

The Narendra Modi government believes in the independence of the judiciary and hence it did not take any step undermining it, he said.
“But the judiciary should not get into the role of the Executive. When judges make oral comments, it gets wide coverage even though such comments have no bearing (on the case) whatsoever. A judge should speak through his or her order instead of making unnecessary comments and inviting criticism,” Rijiju said.

Lamenting the large number of cases which get filed in courts across the country, Rijiju said most of the cases could be settled outside the courts.“We are introducing the mediation bill and I am hopeful it will be cleared in the upcoming winter session. A large number of cases can be settled through mediation,” he said.

To make the courts accessible to more and more people, lawyers should be allowed to argue in the language they are comfortable in, the law minister said. “We have the technology to translate. This should be used,” he said.

He was very upset when the Supreme Court “struck down” the sedition law despite the government assuring that it was reviewing the law, Rijiju said.

“When the government has already said that the law and its provisions were old and hence we were taking a review of it, the Supreme Court struck it down. That is when I said everyone has a Lakshman Rekha that they should not cross,” Rijiju said. The Supreme Court in May this year suspended pending criminal trials and court proceedings under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code.
