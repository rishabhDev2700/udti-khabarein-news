        "title": "Fittest should be appointed, not someone whom Collegium knows: Law Minister Rijiju",
        "body": `
        Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday said the present Supreme Court collegium system through which judges are appointed is “opaque”.

The “fittest” persons should be appointed as judges and not someone whom the collegium knows, he said.

The Union minister was speaking on 'Reforming Judiciary at the India Today conclave here. “I am not critical of the judiciary or the judges…I am not happy with the present system of the Supreme Court collegium. No system is perfect. We have to always strive and work towards a better system,” the minister said. The system has to be accountable and transparent, he said, adding, “If it is opaque, then who else will speak up against it if not the concerned minister.” He was only “reflecting the thinking” of the people including the lawyer community and even some judges, he said.

“The basic fault with the present collegium system is that the judges are recommending those colleagues whom they know. Obviously, they would not recommend a judge they do not know,” Rijiju said.

“The fittest should be appointed and not someone whom the collegium knows,” the minister said.
Asked how the process would be different if the government were to be involved, Rijiju said the government has an independent mechanism to collect information and carry out due diligence.

“The government has the intelligence bureau and several other reports to rely on before taking a decision. The judiciary or the judges do not have this,” he said.

Across the world, governments appoint judges, the law minister said.
“There is politics in the judiciary too because of this. They (judges) may not show it but there is intense politics,” Rijiju said.

“Should the judges be stuck in such administrative work or spend more time in dispensing justice,” he asked.

On the Supreme Court rejecting the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, Rijiju said the government had not said anything on it so far.

“When it was struck down, the government could have done something…but it did not as it respects the judiciary. But that does not mean we will keep quiet always,” he said.

The Narendra Modi government believes in the independence of the judiciary and hence it did not take any step undermining it, he said.
“But the judiciary should not get into the role of the Executive. When judges make oral comments, it gets wide coverage even though such comments have no bearing (on the case) whatsoever. A judge should speak through his or her order instead of making unnecessary comments and inviting criticism,” Rijiju said.

Lamenting the large number of cases which get filed in courts across the country, Rijiju said most of the cases could be settled outside the courts.“We are introducing the mediation bill and I am hopeful it will be cleared in the upcoming winter session. A large number of cases can be settled through mediation,” he said.

To make the courts accessible to more and more people, lawyers should be allowed to argue in the language they are comfortable in, the law minister said. “We have the technology to translate. This should be used,” he said.

He was very upset when the Supreme Court “struck down” the sedition law despite the government assuring that it was reviewing the law, Rijiju said.

“When the government has already said that the law and its provisions were old and hence we were taking a review of it, the Supreme Court struck it down. That is when I said everyone has a Lakshman Rekha that they should not cross,” Rijiju said. The Supreme Court in May this year suspended pending criminal trials and court proceedings under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code.

        "title": "How small businesses can crack the right product-market fit",
        "body": `
        Ease of doing business for MSMEs: If there can be a perfect name given to a particular period, the one we live in today could be best described as the ‘age of entrepreneurs’. India has become one of the largest playgrounds for small businesses and start-ups, as a report suggests that there are over 77000 registered start-ups in India. Besides these start-ups, the total number of small businesses (including micro and small-sized enterprises) is estimated to be 42.50 million. The journey from micro to small and small to medium-sized businesses can take years. Also, building a profitable venture can take a few years. However, if an entrepreneur can crack the right product, something which the consumers want and can address an existing problem, it can play a pivotal role in shortening this journey. However, it is also a fact that almost 95% of new product ideas fail after or even before their introduction to the marketplace.  Also, only cracking a good product will not help. What is needed is to be able to build a product that solves a problem and continue to iterate it as the market evolves or as consumer preferences change. This is critical and big brands that haven’t evolved their products over a period of time have had to face huge losses and even face existential issues. 
        Cracking the code for introducing the right product in the market can be a critical task, especially for small businesses that do not have the luxury of research and development resources and substantial capital backup. Also, young brands may not be able to get market intelligence in case they intend to venture into an unexplored category. 

Here are a few tips that can be helpful while designing or conceiving a new product or service: 

Locating the target consumer 

The first step would be to locate the target consumer of the product or service the business intends to provide. The question here would be whether the company would cater to the masses or just a tiny section of society. It is critical to notice who would benefit from the product or service. It is a difficult step and requires product analysis, in-depth market research, and an understanding of your competition. This might mean that a business might have to shelve out time and resources in the first step itself, but it would be worth it as the overall probability of a failed product can be reduced considerably.

Identification of customer pain points 

After locating the target customers, a business must find out whether the proposed product or service can address the issues and pain points they face. For instance, if a company wants to address transportation-related challenges faced by the people of a Tier II city in India, it shall also be critical to find out the affordability of the product/service along with the transportation infrastructure, digital literacy, and the issues with the existing services in the market.  

If we take the case of a fintech company that is trying to build a product to enable credit access for the masses, it is advisable to understand why big players like banks have not been able to address this challenge that has existed for long. This is when the concerned company will realize that there are existing gaps around reach, the process being followed and a limited number of customers being a part of the formal banking system. 

Having a clear value proposition 

The value proposition is your core idea of providing the best service or product for your customers and beating out your competitors in the process. For instance, a small business might not compete with large automobile companies in EV manufacturing. However, it can develop ideas and solutions to facilitate mobile charging stations at critical junctures across a city. This will not only make the business a significant part of the EV infrastructure but also ensure that the idea can deliver and transfer value to the customers.  

Testing the product before rolling out 

One of the most significant issues a product fails is the lack of testing and the inability to gain feedback from the end users before its eventual rollout. Any small business organisation should ensure that the product is provided for testing to the employees, friends, and acquaintances before the marketing processes for the rollout could begin. If you operate in the B2B space, it is advisable that the product is rolled out to a small set of customers so that the company can address any gaps/ issues that may crop up.

Even though this would mean that the actual launch would be delayed a bit, this could be a significant step towards saving a lot of money and resources otherwise spent on an eventually failed product. Even if a small business plans to develop a consumable material, this step could be taken by providing samples to the users.

To sum up, the size of a business enterprise does not guarantee that each of its products or services will be accepted by the public. Cracking the correct code for product development could be pretty tricky. There are many examples where some of the world’s largest and most influential companies have made a mistake whilst conceiving, designing, and introducing a product in the market. Even though following these steps would not guarantee the success of a new product or service, it eliminates a significant amount of risk, which is a critical consideration for a small business enterprise.

        "body": `
        Virat Kohli loves playing in Australia and there is no question about it. He not only loves playing in the Down Under but has a legion of Aussie fans who are fascinated by his approach, which is traditionally associated with champion sides and players from Australia.
        Be it the infamous ‘fingergate’ incident in Sydney, his first overseas Test century in Adelaide, his stunning 86-ball 133 against Sri Lanka in the ODI match in Hobart or winning the Border-Gavaskar Test series in 2018-19 as a captain, Kohli has owned the Australian shores. The Australian media and former cricketers are still gushing over his epic performance, the 82 not out against Pakistan at the MCG– a knock straight from the Australian playbook of winning games that seemed lost at one stage. Chappell brothers (Ian and Greg) are yet to digest his two sixes against Haris Rauf. Greg Chappell in a column for the Sydney Morning Herald has declared his innings as “A song of god,”, and he struck a metaphor from the book Bhagavad Gita to describe his October 23 heroics. It is not surprising that Kohli, too, likes playing in Australia. In a video shared by the BCCI.TV, he said: “Australia doesn’t feel alien anymore.”
        “Pata nahi kya hai yaar, ek comfortable feeling aati hai yahaan pe aa ke (I don’t know what it is, but i feel really comfortable whenever I come here).”

“Yahaan pe ek cheez maine dekhi hai na yahaan pe agar aap perfrom karo toh ek respect milti hai aapko, appreciation wo mujhe abhi pata chalta hai. Not just Indian fans but the locals too. (I have noticed one thing recently that if you perform here, you will be appreciated by the lcoal fans as well).

“Local Aussies fan ko khushi hoti hai mujhko dekh kar. Mereko out of place kabhi lagta hi nahi hai Australia mei. Mai ghoomta hun toh aisa lagta hai yaar ki apni jagah hi hai ye (The local Aussie fans approaches me like I am one of their’s. I never feel out of place here. It feels like home away from home for me),” he added.

With 220 runs in four matches, Virat Kohli is the leading run-getter of the T20 World Cup. He also speaks about his camaraderie with Rohit Sharma and the mood in the Indian camp.
“Rohit and I have a similar vision – to make India win.’ It’s very free-flowing, it is all pointed towards main goal,” he said.

“Baat toh special yahi hoti hai ki humey bada tournament kaise jeetna hai. Preparation, planning to sab us hisaab se hi hoti hai. Team ka mahool bahut acha hai aur jab aisi camarderie aur mahool hota hai toh aap excited hote ho khelne ke liye. (We generally talk about how to win the big tournaments. How we should execute the preparation and planning. When you have such kind of camarderie and environment in the team, you always feels excited to play the game.) You look forward to do anything for the team,” he added. India will play their last Super 12 game against Zimbabwe in Sydney on Sunday.

        "body": `
        Vafa Hakhamaneshi escaped his marker, powered the ball past goalkeeper, dashed towards the cameras and lifted his t-shirt. Such goal celebrations are rather common in football but Vafa wanted to use the moment — his first goal in India and his club Chennaiyin — to send out a message.

On the vest of the Iranian footballer were words of support for the women in his country. They read: #women #life #freedom for 11:11.

These words have gained resonance among Iranians in the last few months. Following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died in police custody in Tehran on September 13, arrested for not wearing the Hijab, protests have erupted across the country. The words on Vafa’s vest were reportedly chanted during Amini’s funeral by protesters, who are breaking the hijab law as a show of dissent. And in the days that followed, Iran’s footballers joined in. However, the show of solidarity, which came in the Indian Super League match against East Bengal on Friday, resulted in Vafa receiving a second yellow card, and thus being sent off. According to the rules, players are sanctioned by referees if they remove their shirt during celebration or even of they lift a shirt to reveal a political message.

Hakhamaneshi, however, did not seem deterred. The 31-year-old Iranian was already shown a yellow card for a foul in the 60th minute.

His goal nine minutes later, though, was enough for Chennaiyin to seal the win. Chennaiyin defeated East Bengal 1-0, their second win of the season while the Kolkata side suffered its fourth defeat in front of more than 17,000 fans. Hakhamaneshi, a defender, joined Chennaiyin from Thai club Ratchaburi ahead of this season. Iran’s footballers have shown support to Amini, leading with their talismanic attacker Sardar Azmoun, who posted a social media message last month. Then, during their final match ahead of the World Cup against Senegal, the Iranian team came out of the dugout wearing black jackets to cover their national team logos during the national anthem in support of the women of Iran. Other football legends like former Bayern Munich player, once dubbed the ‘Asian Maradona,’ Ali Karimi, and Iran striker Ali Daei were also vocal in their support on social media. Iranian player Zobeir Niknafs also shaved his head in solidarity with Amini and Iranian women.

        "body": `Australia’s title defence at the T20 World Cup is no longer in their own hands after a massive opening-day defeat against New Zealand dented their Net Run Rate (NRR). On Friday against Afghanistan, the team were in dire need of a win by a massive margin against Afghanistan but narrowly escaped with a four-run victory in the final over. Losing the NRR battle, they will now need Sri Lanka to defeat England on Saturday in order to qualify for the semifinals.

Aussie greats like Michael Clarke, Adam Gilchrist, and Shane Watson questioned the side’s approach in dropping Mitchell Starc from the bowling lineup, especially when they needed to take quick wickets to win by a big margin.

“Strange one. He’s got to be injured. There’s absolutely no way you can leave him out of tonight’s game,” Clarke said on commentary per Fox Sports. “If anyone’s going to rip through Afghanistan’s batting it’s Mitchell Starc. Left arm, if it swings with the new ball and then we’ve seen his yorkers at the death. I don’t get it.”
The former Australian captain reiterated his confusion over Starc’s absence while commentating on the game. “No Mitchell Starc. I still can’t believe it to be honest. I think we saw a bit of swing. I think Starc right now with the new ball swinging back into the right-handers would’ve been lethal,” he said. “He’d have been my first bowler picked against this Afghanistan line-up.”
On commentary, Gilchrist mentioned that Starc was left out from the side to which Watson responded: “Are we going to go there?” Former Australian cricketers Mark Waugh and Tom Moody took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the left-armer’s absence. “Starc should be playing. He is (an) aggressive wicket-taking bowler who could easily rip through Afghanistan. (Kane) Richardson more of a holding type bowler,” Vaugh tweeted. Even Afghanistan’s coach Jonathan Trott, the former England batsman, was surprised. ”It was a little bit of a surprise to us. We’re not sure why Starc didn’t play …. Obviously, we saw Richardson marking his run-up. That was a real surprise for us – we don’t know any reason.” Australia assistant coach Daniel Vettori revealed that Starc was fit, and his omission was based on Kane Richardson’s superior economy rate at the death. “It was a tactical decision,” he said post-match. “We brought in Kane to play the role he executed tonight at the back-end of the powerplay, looking at the death overs where Kane has been exceptional in the past.”

        "title": "Petrochemicals industry to act as catalyst to realize India’s $5-trillion-dollar-economy vision",
        "body": `
        Petrochemicals are a vital cog in the global industrial arena and a major growth driver for economies. India has also been riding the petrochemicals wave, with increased domestic consumption and rising demand globally. The accelerated demand has been against the backdrop of its rising acceptance among diverse industry sectors such as medicines, construction, agriculture, textiles, automotive, etc.
        In 2020, the per capita consumption of polymer in India was around 12 kilograms. This was way below the global average of 37 kilograms. With the progressive GDP trajectory, it is expected that the demand for petrochemical products will continue to grow significantly during the next twenty years. A recent Kearney-India study said that India is emerging as a global hub for petrochemical activity, which can be attributed to the wide gap in domestic consumption of petrochemicals.
        Government thrust to curate a petro-ecosystem

The government’s ongoing efforts to promote economic development in India are the main factor influencing the expansion of the petrochemical industry. The Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals (DCPC) of the Government of India (GoI) has implemented several initiatives to improve the industry’s overall competitiveness, quality, and output. Initiatives such as Make in India, Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, and the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme are implemented to attract domestic manufacturing and facilitate exports.

Some of the notable measures for promoting the growth of the petrochemical industry are the mandatory standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), public procurement policies for chemicals and petrochemicals, schemes for setting up plastic parks, and adequate support for research and innovation by setting up centers of excellence. All these policy incentives, low cost of manufacturing capital goods and manpower, and overall demand scenario are boosting business confidence to plan larger petrochemical complexes in India. It is evident from recent project announcements by major public sector units, private sector refiners, and niche specialty chemical players.

Opportunities galore

While India emerges strong in the petrochemical sector, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is fertile to capitalize on new opportunities. Firstly, India’s energy demand is rising at an unprecedented pace. By 2030, India’s oil demand will significantly rise from its current consumption. Besides domestic opportunities, the global scenario substantiates international exposure further.

Over the years, China has been considered the major hub for petrochemicals. However, in recent times, the chemical industry in China is facing stricter environmental norms, approvals of which are necessary to source financing. This is slowly forcing the world to look at India as a potential market, especially in certain value chains and segments, providing India with the right platform for setting up these industries.

There is another, more urgent need to transform India into a petrochemical hub. Petrochemical intermediates are the primary feedstock for specialty chemicals and constitute a large portion of petrochemical imports. India is an attractive market for global companies, thanks to its per capita income, rapidly changing lifestyle, and rising demand from the end-use industries. With the rising domestic demand and the current import dependence, India potentially needs world-scale petrochemical assets by 2035.

Attracting investments

To promote investment in the chemical and petrochemicals sector, active steps are being taken in amending the PCPIR policy. The proposed new PCPIR policy will be implemented between 2020–35 and is expected to attract an approximate combined investment of over INR 34 lakh crores (USD 420 billion) for the sector. So, the refining industry is gearing up for expansions. The gross refinery margins can receive a steady impetus from value-added petrochemical derivatives, the demand for which is quite potent given the current factors. Investments in petrochemicals are also being planned as part of these refinery expansions.

The Sagarmala Programme that channels towards port modernization, development, and connectivity will help over 800 projects worth INR 5.48 lakh crores billion between 2015–2035 to reduce costs incurred for import and export trade. It will also encourage domestic trade with minimal investment in infrastructure development. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate for newly incorporated domestic manufacturing companies to 15% from 25% will make the return on investments made in India more attractive.

Here is what we should look at

India’s refinery and petrochemical hubs could construct industrial parks where focused innovation may be employed to create unique models for investors, replete with incentive programs. Making viable investment possibilities is the aim. Again, the growth of the sector also depends on the incubation of entrepreneurial initiatives, especially through talent development. Budding business owners in the sector have a wide selection of possibilities from both the plastic and textile clusters. Masterbatches, films, car parts, looms, packaging, and even spinning and weaving are a few of them. The sector could, in short, be leveraged for job creation, nation-building, and economic development.

How the sector is gearing up

In a time of uncertainties shaped by geopolitical setbacks, policy tightening measures, and disruption of global supply chains, delays in these planned petrochemical projects are already being handled effectively with promising growth from intrinsic sectors within India. Given the distinctive features of the Indian market, it is likely that the industry would see more win-win alliances between international and domestic businesses.

Domestic players can benefit from their global partners’ financial, technological, and operational know-how to expedite their growth strategies. Global firms can profit from their local partners’ comprehensive knowledge of the Indian market, their systems for sales and distribution, and their marketing prowess. Domestically, effective collaboration between private players and the government can strengthen the Indian chemical industry. How the industry maps its actions could shape the sector’s future and help India realize its dream of becoming a 5-trillion-dollar economy.

The journey from micro to small and small to medium-sized businesses can take years. Also, building a profitable venture can take a few years. However, if an entrepreneur can crack the right product, something which the consumers want and can address an existing problem, it can play a pivotal role in shortening this journey. However, it is also a fact that almost 95% of new product ideas fail after or even before their introduction to the marketplace.  Also, only cracking a good product will not help. What is needed is to be able to build a product that solves a problem and continue to iterate it as the market evolves or as consumer preferences change. This is critical and big brands that haven’t evolved their products over a period of time have had to face huge losses and even face existential issues. 
        Cracking the code for introducing the right product in the market can be a critical task, especially for small businesses that do not have the luxury of research and development resources and substantial capital backup. Also, young brands may not be able to get market intelligence in case they intend to venture into an unexplored category. 

Here are a few tips that can be helpful while designing or conceiving a new product or service: 

Locating the target consumer 

The first step would be to locate the target consumer of the product or service the business intends to provide. The question here would be whether the company would cater to the masses or just a tiny section of society. It is critical to notice who would benefit from the product or service. It is a difficult step and requires product analysis, in-depth market research, and an understanding of your competition. This might mean that a business might have to shelve out time and resources in the first step itself, but it would be worth it as the overall probability of a failed product can be reduced considerably.

Identification of customer pain points 

After locating the target customers, a business must find out whether the proposed product or service can address the issues and pain points they face. For instance, if a company wants to address transportation-related challenges faced by the people of a Tier II city in India, it shall also be critical to find out the affordability of the product/service along with the transportation infrastructure, digital literacy, and the issues with the existing services in the market.  

If we take the case of a fintech company that is trying to build a product to enable credit access for the masses, it is advisable to understand why big players like banks have not been able to address this challenge that has existed for long. This is when the concerned company will realize that there are existing gaps around reach, the process being followed and a limited number of customers being a part of the formal banking system. 

Having a clear value proposition 

The value proposition is your core idea of providing the best service or product for your customers and beating out your competitors in the process. For instance, a small business might not compete with large automobile companies in EV manufacturing. However, it can develop ideas and solutions to facilitate mobile charging stations at critical junctures across a city. This will not only make the business a significant part of the EV infrastructure but also ensure that the idea can deliver and transfer value to the customers.  

Testing the product before rolling out 

One of the most significant issues a product fails is the lack of testing and the inability to gain feedback from the end users before its eventual rollout. Any small business organisation should ensure that the product is provided for testing to the employees, friends, and acquaintances before the marketing processes for the rollout could begin. If you operate in the B2B space, it is advisable that the product is rolled out to a small set of customers so that the company can address any gaps/ issues that may crop up.

Even though this would mean that the actual launch would be delayed a bit, this could be a significant step towards saving a lot of money and resources otherwise spent on an eventually failed product. Even if a small business plans to develop a consumable material, this step could be taken by providing samples to the users.

To sum up, the size of a business enterprise does not guarantee that each of its products or services will be accepted by the public. Cracking the correct code for product development could be pretty tricky. There are many examples where some of the world’s largest and most influential companies have made a mistake whilst conceiving, designing, and introducing a product in the market. Even though following these steps would not guarantee the success of a new product or service, it eliminates a significant amount of risk, which is a critical consideration for a small business enterprise.

        "title": "Why and how do MSME entrepreneurs need to tackle changes?",
        "body": `
        Ease of Doing Business for MSMEs: India is home to approximately 63 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). The MSME sector has emerged as a vibrant and dynamic segment of the Indian economy, growing at an annual rate of 18% and contributing about 30% to the national gross domestic product (GDP). MSMEs play an important role in social development, especially in the semi-urban and rural areas of the country, are integral to employment generation, and wealth creation and keep the wheel of the economy running. With the pandemic accelerating digitization, MSMEs must create a digital presence and adapt to a new way of running their businesses. From sourcing to answering customer queries, to marketing, MSMEs need to redefine their business practices.

Workforce management
A growing number of MSMEs, especially in the service sector, have been employing techniques that utilize staff with the right skill sets at the right places, at the right times to minimise risks and increase productivity, especially due to the advent of the hybrid mode of working. This ensures that organizations have a clear direction as to how future decisions will be made. By setting both short- and long-term objectives, MSMEs and entrepreneurs can gather the data thus allowing them to see overlaps and process gaps, and create standardized and even automated processes.

However, as systems and processes are put into place for ensuring productivity and profitability, it is key that MSME leaders are cognizant of establishing and maintaining organisational culture.  The culture defines how the company relates to its human resources, how it adjusts its strategies and goals and how it creates and interacts with its customer base. As the behaviour of workers is easily influenced by the philosophy and beliefs of the manager or owner, it is crucial that the leader not only establishes a code of ethics but also embodies them.

Governance for all
As per a global survey on corporate governance, more than 50 per cent of the respondents comprising of senior management stated that the standards of integrity had not grown and have in fact deteriorated over the past two years. Be it scrutiny from regulators, a greater number of responsibilities on business leaders, or investor expectations – these factors have shown the need for an ethical framework within organisations. For MSMEs, governance may seem like a tedious activity, especially when their focus usually lies on core operations such as building a customer base and profitability. However, organisations that undermine creating an internal governance framework may face challenges due to reputational damage, fines, contract terminations and loss of investor confidence, among others. For instance, if a customer or a stakeholder feels their concerns were not appropriately addressed, they may resort to voicing their issues on an online forum which will have reputational and even financial repercussions. It has thus become imperative for MSMEs to create a strong governance framework to drive sustainable long-term growth and create value for all stakeholders.

Diversification is a necessity
Although MSMEs, especially in the service industry was severely impacted by the pandemic, they made a strong recovery because of their willingness to diversify their operations. For instance, a household product entrepreneur who catered to a B2B space was forced to pivot during the pandemic and address the demands of a B2C space, thus helping him address not only quality and product needs but also consumer expectations. Diversification not only helps businesses understand the changing expectations of the customers, but it also plays a major role in transforming a business’s narrative. However, while diversification is a suitable response to the demands of a post-pandemic business environment, MSMEs must also do their due diligence and conduct risk analysis and take carefully considered decisions. Technological measures such as digitization and automation have become a must-have and MSMEs must be quick to adapt the latest tools and know-how to stay relevant.

In a post-Covid world, building resilient businesses is key and this can be achieved by investing in the right technologies, setting up the right processes, accessing the right financing options, having strong corporate governance and hiring right. However, many MSMEs are still at a nascent stage and require guidance, mentoring and the right solutions to enable them to build agile digital businesses. Services such as peer learning from like-minded MSME entrepreneurs can help in easy modification, seamless diversification and risk-free decision-making.

        India is poised to dominate the global supply chain and provide an alternative to China for the world, Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran said at his keynote address at a convocation ceremony of Anant National University in Ahmedabad.

“India is not only going to become the third-largest economy in the world in the years to come, but the country will also surpass the $5-trillion economy target soon,” he said, adding, “India’s infrastructure as well as domestic and export growth-led economy will increase the per capita income beyond $2,000 in the coming years.” For the youngsters, these developments will create huge economic opportunities and there would be a large-scale requirement of leadership.” “We’re fortunate we are residing in a country where there’s huge potential for growth. In the near future, global growth will be dominated by developing and emerging economies for decades to come,” he said.   Chandrasekaran told the graduating students that they are coming into the market at a pivotal moment in history as in the past 2-3 years people had experienced a complex and different world. “We all witnessed something which we hope to never experience in our lifetime again. We witnessed lots of hardships and it proved how resilient we are. However, all these have also created lots of opportunities too, especially in the digital technology space,” he said.

The adoption and use of digital technology in the past couple of years has almost gained a decade of acceleration as the world believed in it, he said.

        "title": "When Farah Khan would strip Shah Rukh Khan every week to do an ab check for Dard-E-Disco: ‘Effect on females was distracting",
        "body": `Recently, Farah Khan’s movie Om Shanti Om, celebrated 15 years of its release. The movie had launched Deepika Padukone’s Bollywood career with none other than superstar Shah Rukh Khan.
Om Shanti Om was known for paying a funny yet heartwarming hat-tip to Bollywood and its glory years. Apart from its dialogues and its star power, the film was also quite popular for its hit soundtrack, composed by Vishal-Shekhar. The dance number “Dard-E-Disco” saw Shah Rukh in a never-seen-before avatar as he thumped and grooved to Sukhwinder Singh-sung pop number. The actor had worked out intensely to get his perfect abs which he showed plenty of in the song, much to his fans’ delight. Writer Mushtaq Sheikh, who is a close friend of both Farah and SRK’s, had described the making of the music video in his book The Making of Om Shanti Om. “The effect on the female members of the crew was very distracting with some of them having to be dragged off the set while the song was being shot,” read a section of the book as the author went on to detail how the filmmaker kept a tab on her actor’s progress: “Every week, Farah would strip Shah Rukh to do an ab check.” 
In the same book, Sheikh wrote that a makeshift gym was built inside the studio so that Shah Rukh could work out even between his shoot for the song. Farah Khan, in an earlier interview with Film Companion, had shared that she shot the song pregnant and would often had to take vomit breaks in between the shoot as she suffered from bouts of sickness.

        "title": "Akshay Kumar on son Aarav’s disinterest in Bollywood, being questioned for working in 4 films a year: ‘I am not stealing for anyone’",
        "body": `
        Actor Akshay Kumar is clueless why his decision to feature in multiple films a year gets flak. The actor, who starred in five releases this year alone, feels he is attacked for this unfairly. The conversation around his multiple releases a year increased this year after Akshay delivered four consecutive flops– Bachchan Pandey, Samrat Prithviraj, Raksha Bandhan and Ram Setu. His solo OTT release, Cuttputlli, also opened to poor reviews.

During the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2022, when asked why he works so much, Akshay wondered what’s wrong in doing work on time. “Tell me, does anyone here ask their kids why they work so much? People ask ítni gambling kyun karta hai, itna peeta kyun hai (why do you gamble so much, why do you drink so much)’. But who questions someone for working a lot?”
Akshay said if he gets the opportunity to do multiple films in a year, he would continue to do that as he is not “stealing from anyone” and working. “I do four films a year. Yes, I do it. I do ads, sure. I work, but I am not stealing from anyone. I don’t understand. Media persons ask me why do you get up early? But morning is for waking up, right. They ask me why do you sleep so early. ‘Arre bewakoof, raat ko sota hai aadmi (You fool, people sleep at night).’

“I don’t understand what I am doing wrong. I will work, who won’t if they have a chance to do work. I will do four films. I will give 50 days if required and 90 days if needed,” he added.
At the event, the actor also opened up about how his son Aarav is not interested in watching films. Akshay said he wants to show Aarav films, wants to have discussion about it–but his son is simply not interested.
“I was just thinking about how different it is in my home. I want to show my son films, I want to tell him about films, he doesn’t want to see films. I want to put him into all that, but he just doesn’t want to see anything, he just wants to do his work. He wants to study or do his fashion designing. So there are two ways of doing it: one, you keep it hidden or you give them so much that they don’t want to do it,” Akshay added.

        "body": `
        American actor Lindsay Lohan has addressed the question on whether she is willing to work on sequels to some of her past hit films like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. According to Deadline, Lohan recently made an appearance on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon where she was asked by the host about being in the potential sequels. This question came after Jamie Lee Curtis expressed interest in making a follow-up movie to Freaky Friday and during the show Lohan did acknowledge that Curtis had reached out to her.

“I was on set filming at the time and Jamie Lee Curtis writes you, you just get excited and distracted immediately. So I had to bring myself down to Earth and be like, ‘OK, I’m on set, I have to focus.’ And then she said Freaky Friday 2 and I got more excited,” she recalled, reported Deadline.
The actor further stated that she and Curtis “would both be into” making another film based on their Freaky Friday characters.
According to the outlet, Fallon then snuck in the question about a sequel to Mean Girls and Lohan said that a follow-up movie would be “in Tina Fey’s hands.” Back in October, when Curtis had appeared on The View, she revealed having an idea for a Freaky Friday sequel where Lohan would play a “hot grandma.”
Although Curtis claimed she offered the idea to Disney executives, it is not yet known whether they are thinking about producing a sequel, as per Variety.

        Varun Dhawan left fans rather impressed with his gesture during the Bhediya promotions in Jaipur. One of his fans fell sick and the actor jumped in to help and comfort her.

A fan page shared a video of Varun sitting on the floor below the stage and offering water to the girl, who fell sick presumably because of the heat and crowd. Another volunteer was seen beside them while Kriti gave instructions standing on the stage. The Student of the Year actor also indulged in a conversation with the fan, making sure she was feeling okay.

As the video went viral, fans were quick to drop heartfelt messages on the post. “He is literally the bestMy VD,” one fan wrote, while another added, “How sweet of him! No doubt #VarunDhawan is both a great actor and amazing human being. God bless him.”
On Saturday, Varun and Kriti were in Jaipur to promote Bhediya, the first creature based horror-comedy in India. Sharing a video of him dancing with Kriti on “Thumkeshwari”, Varun posted, “Jaipur ne apna bana liya 25 th ko bhediya.”

At the launch of “Thumkeshwari” in Mumbai, Varun had spoken about how he wants the audience to enjoy his films. “Since the time I became an actor, my aim has always been to entertain the audience. I don’t want to impart knowledge but make the audience enjoy a film (gyaan nahi batna par public ko enjoy karana hai),” PTI reported.
The film from the stables of Dinesh Vijan is directed by Stree fame Amar Kaushik. Lauding his director, the actor further said, “Stree was a paisa vasool film and so is Bhediya with top-class VFX. Amar has worked very hard. Hopefully, we will not let you down and you will feel proud. We want to bring the public to theatres.” Also starring Deepak Dobriyal and Abhishek Banerjee, Bhediya will hit cinema halls on November 25.

        "body": `
        Former Himachal Pradesh BJP president Khimi Ram defected from the party unit to join Congress earlier this year and now the Opposition party, which is looking to return to power, has fielded him from his home turf Banjar in Kullu district. Further dealing a blow to the ruling party's chances is an internal rebellion in the constituency.

The 73-year-old entered politics in the 1990s and held a post in the district council. He went on to contest elections from Banjar in 2003 on a BJP ticket and won. He retained the seat in the Assembly polls four years later. The same year, Khimi was also elected Deputy Speaker of the state Assembly.

With Dhumal’s backing he became the state BJP president in 2009 after Jai Ram Thakur, the current chief minister, was inducted into the Cabinet. The following year, Ram was unanimously re-elected to the post. But his tenure was marked by infighting in the state unit and saw the exit of former state party president and former MP Maheshwar Singh in December 2011 over his decision to drop Naveen Dhiman and Tikku Thakur from the BJP’s state body and district unit.
Thakur was later removed as the president and moved to cabinet in the Dhumal government. He was denied an election ticket in 2017 despite expressing his desire to contest the Assembly elections again from Banjar.
The Banjar seat will be looking at a three-way contest between Ram, incumbent MLA Surender Shourie of the BJP and Maheshwar Singh’s son Hiteshwar Singh, who is contesting as an Independent. Maheshwar’s Singh ticket was cancelled after he failed to convince Hiteshwar to withdraw his candidature.

        "body": `For India’s democracy to really work, it needs smaller units of governance, Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee said Friday.

        “There is a fundamental problem with the design of our democracy which is that our states are way too large. We have twenty times larger seats for Parliament than the United Kingdom has,” Banerjee said.
        
        Banerjee was delivering the 27th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture on the “Democracy on the ground: What works, what doesn’t and why?”
        
        Banerjee said that although India has a population 20 times that of the UK, the UK has 656 seats in its Parliament compared to 543 in India. He argued that the vast size makes it difficult for all voters to access information about their legislators.
        Citing his field experiments with Delhi municipal elections, Banerjee said that if voters are given information on the performance of those elected, their pattern of voting changes. “There’s almost nothing that a legislator does that can really reach you (the voter). Therefore, the leaders on the ground matter very little for our voters. That’s a structural problem in our democracy,” Banerjee said.
        
        Justice Hima Kohli of the Supreme Court also spoke at the event, recounting her memories of Justice Bhandare. “Very few know that she joined law college after she got married and she had enrolled with the Maharashtra Bar Council when she was a mother of two,” Justice Kohli said. Justice Bhandare was a former judge of the Delhi High Court who died in office at the age of 52.`,

        "body": `
        AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal on Friday welcomed the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish
    Kumar, and urged the Congress in Assam and the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC to join the opposition grouping to
    defeat the ruling BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.
    
    Ajmal, a Lok Sabha MP from Dhubri constituency, said Kumar and leaders of the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ will visit
    Assam next month to explore possibilities of expanding the grouping. The Congress is a part of the
    ‘Mahagathbandhan’ in Bihar.
    
    “When they will come, I hope that the Congress (in Assam) and Mamata Banerjee will join the
    ‘Mahagathbandhan’. Our common enemy is the BJP and together we will be able to defeat them in 2024,” he told
    reporters here.
    Ajmal also sought to form an alliance again with its former ally Congress for the panchayat and Lok Sabha
    elections in Assam in order to defeat their “common enemy BJP”.
    “Unless we are united, we cannot defeat the BJP. So, let us join hands again for defeating the BJP,” he
    said.
    
    Reacting to Ajmal’s proposal, Assam Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said no such alliance will take
    place between the two opposition parties again in the future.
    
    “We have been always saying that AIUDF is equally communal like the BJP. We will form an alliance with the
    people of Dhubri, but not with a trader,” he said referring to Ajmal’s perfume business.
    Interestingly, the Congress on November 1 kick-started the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ in Assam from Dhubri
    district, Ajmal’s home turf, and plans to cover 834 km in the next 70 days.
    
    Borah further said, “If an alliance takes place between the Congress and AIUDF, I will not be the president
    of the state Congress.” Prior to the Assam Assembly elections in 2021, the Congress had formed a ‘Grand
    Alliance’ with AIUDF, BPF, CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML), Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM), RJD, Adivasi National Party
    (ANP) and Jimochayan (Deori) Peoples Party (JPP) to fight against the BJP-led NDA.
    
    After facing defeat, the Congress in August last year broke the alliance with AIUDF. The core committee of
    the state Congress also opted to break its association with the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), while the
    CPI(M) said it only had a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress and was not a part of any alliance.

        "title": "Fittest should be appointed, not someone whom Collegium knows: Law Minister Rijiju",
        "body": `
        Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday said the present Supreme Court collegium system through which judges are appointed is “opaque”.

The “fittest” persons should be appointed as judges and not someone whom the collegium knows, he said.

The Union minister was speaking on 'Reforming Judiciary at the India Today conclave here. “I am not critical of the judiciary or the judges…I am not happy with the present system of the Supreme Court collegium. No system is perfect. We have to always strive and work towards a better system,” the minister said. The system has to be accountable and transparent, he said, adding, “If it is opaque, then who else will speak up against it if not the concerned minister.” He was only “reflecting the thinking” of the people including the lawyer community and even some judges, he said.

“The basic fault with the present collegium system is that the judges are recommending those colleagues whom they know. Obviously, they would not recommend a judge they do not know,” Rijiju said.

“The fittest should be appointed and not someone whom the collegium knows,” the minister said.
Asked how the process would be different if the government were to be involved, Rijiju said the government has an independent mechanism to collect information and carry out due diligence.

“The government has the intelligence bureau and several other reports to rely on before taking a decision. The judiciary or the judges do not have this,” he said.

Across the world, governments appoint judges, the law minister said.
“There is politics in the judiciary too because of this. They (judges) may not show it but there is intense politics,” Rijiju said.

“Should the judges be stuck in such administrative work or spend more time in dispensing justice,” he asked.

On the Supreme Court rejecting the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, Rijiju said the government had not said anything on it so far.

“When it was struck down, the government could have done something…but it did not as it respects the judiciary. But that does not mean we will keep quiet always,” he said.

The Narendra Modi government believes in the independence of the judiciary and hence it did not take any step undermining it, he said.
“But the judiciary should not get into the role of the Executive. When judges make oral comments, it gets wide coverage even though such comments have no bearing (on the case) whatsoever. A judge should speak through his or her order instead of making unnecessary comments and inviting criticism,” Rijiju said.

Lamenting the large number of cases which get filed in courts across the country, Rijiju said most of the cases could be settled outside the courts.“We are introducing the mediation bill and I am hopeful it will be cleared in the upcoming winter session. A large number of cases can be settled through mediation,” he said.

To make the courts accessible to more and more people, lawyers should be allowed to argue in the language they are comfortable in, the law minister said. “We have the technology to translate. This should be used,” he said.

He was very upset when the Supreme Court “struck down” the sedition law despite the government assuring that it was reviewing the law, Rijiju said.

“When the government has already said that the law and its provisions were old and hence we were taking a review of it, the Supreme Court struck it down. That is when I said everyone has a Lakshman Rekha that they should not cross,” Rijiju said. The Supreme Court in May this year suspended pending criminal trials and court proceedings under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code.
