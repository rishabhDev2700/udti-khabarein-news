                "body": `Recently, Farah Khan’s movie Om Shanti Om, celebrated 15 years of its release. The movie had launched Deepika Padukone’s Bollywood career with none other than superstar Shah Rukh Khan.
Om Shanti Om was known for paying a funny yet heartwarming hat-tip to Bollywood and its glory years. Apart from its dialogues and its star power, the film was also quite popular for its hit soundtrack, composed by Vishal-Shekhar. The dance number “Dard-E-Disco” saw Shah Rukh in a never-seen-before avatar as he thumped and grooved to Sukhwinder Singh-sung pop number. The actor had worked out intensely to get his perfect abs which he showed plenty of in the song, much to his fans’ delight. Writer Mushtaq Sheikh, who is a close friend of both Farah and SRK’s, had described the making of the music video in his book The Making of Om Shanti Om. “The effect on the female members of the crew was very distracting with some of them having to be dragged off the set while the song was being shot,” read a section of the book as the author went on to detail how the filmmaker kept a tab on her actor’s progress: “Every week, Farah would strip Shah Rukh to do an ab check.” 
In the same book, Sheikh wrote that a makeshift gym was built inside the studio so that Shah Rukh could work out even between his shoot for the song. Farah Khan, in an earlier interview with Film Companion, had shared that she shot the song pregnant and would often had to take vomit breaks in between the shoot as she suffered from bouts of sickness.

                "body": `
                Actor Akshay Kumar is clueless why his decision to feature in multiple films a year gets flak. The actor, who starred in five releases this year alone, feels he is attacked for this unfairly. The conversation around his multiple releases a year increased this year after Akshay delivered four consecutive flops– Bachchan Pandey, Samrat Prithviraj, Raksha Bandhan and Ram Setu. His solo OTT release, Cuttputlli, also opened to poor reviews.

During the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2022, when asked why he works so much, Akshay wondered what’s wrong in doing work on time. “Tell me, does anyone here ask their kids why they work so much? People ask ítni gambling kyun karta hai, itna peeta kyun hai (why do you gamble so much, why do you drink so much)’. But who questions someone for working a lot?”
Akshay said if he gets the opportunity to do multiple films in a year, he would continue to do that as he is not “stealing from anyone” and working. “I do four films a year. Yes, I do it. I do ads, sure. I work, but I am not stealing from anyone. I don’t understand. Media persons ask me why do you get up early? But morning is for waking up, right. They ask me why do you sleep so early. ‘Arre bewakoof, raat ko sota hai aadmi (You fool, people sleep at night).’

“I don’t understand what I am doing wrong. I will work, who won’t if they have a chance to do work. I will do four films. I will give 50 days if required and 90 days if needed,” he added.
At the event, the actor also opened up about how his son Aarav is not interested in watching films. Akshay said he wants to show Aarav films, wants to have discussion about it–but his son is simply not interested.
“I was just thinking about how different it is in my home. I want to show my son films, I want to tell him about films, he doesn’t want to see films. I want to put him into all that, but he just doesn’t want to see anything, he just wants to do his work. He wants to study or do his fashion designing. So there are two ways of doing it: one, you keep it hidden or you give them so much that they don’t want to do it,” Akshay added.

                "title": "Lindsay Lohan addresses whether she’ll be part of Freaky Friday, Mean Girls potential sequels",
                "body": `
                American actor Lindsay Lohan has addressed the question on whether she is willing to work on sequels to some of her past hit films like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. According to Deadline, Lohan recently made an appearance on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon where she was asked by the host about being in the potential sequels. This question came after Jamie Lee Curtis expressed interest in making a follow-up movie to Freaky Friday and during the show Lohan did acknowledge that Curtis had reached out to her.

“I was on set filming at the time and Jamie Lee Curtis writes you, you just get excited and distracted immediately. So I had to bring myself down to Earth and be like, ‘OK, I’m on set, I have to focus.’ And then she said Freaky Friday 2 and I got more excited,” she recalled, reported Deadline.
The actor further stated that she and Curtis “would both be into” making another film based on their Freaky Friday characters.
According to the outlet, Fallon then snuck in the question about a sequel to Mean Girls and Lohan said that a follow-up movie would be “in Tina Fey’s hands.” Back in October, when Curtis had appeared on The View, she revealed having an idea for a Freaky Friday sequel where Lohan would play a “hot grandma.”
Although Curtis claimed she offered the idea to Disney executives, it is not yet known whether they are thinking about producing a sequel, as per Variety.

                "body": `
                Varun Dhawan left fans rather impressed with his gesture during the Bhediya promotions in Jaipur. One of his fans fell sick and the actor jumped in to help and comfort her.

A fan page shared a video of Varun sitting on the floor below the stage and offering water to the girl, who fell sick presumably because of the heat and crowd. Another volunteer was seen beside them while Kriti gave instructions standing on the stage. The Student of the Year actor also indulged in a conversation with the fan, making sure she was feeling okay.

As the video went viral, fans were quick to drop heartfelt messages on the post. “He is literally the bestMy VD,” one fan wrote, while another added, “How sweet of him! No doubt #VarunDhawan is both a great actor and amazing human being. God bless him.”
On Saturday, Varun and Kriti were in Jaipur to promote Bhediya, the first creature based horror-comedy in India. Sharing a video of him dancing with Kriti on “Thumkeshwari”, Varun posted, “Jaipur ne apna bana liya 25 th ko bhediya.”

At the launch of “Thumkeshwari” in Mumbai, Varun had spoken about how he wants the audience to enjoy his films. “Since the time I became an actor, my aim has always been to entertain the audience. I don’t want to impart knowledge but make the audience enjoy a film (gyaan nahi batna par public ko enjoy karana hai),” PTI reported.
The film from the stables of Dinesh Vijan is directed by Stree fame Amar Kaushik. Lauding his director, the actor further said, “Stree was a paisa vasool film and so is Bhediya with top-class VFX. Amar has worked very hard. Hopefully, we will not let you down and you will feel proud. We want to bring the public to theatres.” Also starring Deepak Dobriyal and Abhishek Banerjee, Bhediya will hit cinema halls on November 25.
